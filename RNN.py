    Problem 3: Recurrent Neural Network 
    In this problem, you will implement the recurrent neural network for sequence classification problems.
    We will use cross entropy as the loss function and stochastic gradient descent to train the model parameters.
    You could test the correctness of your code by typing `nosetests test3.py` in the terminal.
    Note: please do NOT use torch.nn.RNN, implement your own version of RNN using only basic tensor operations.

        Input:
            z:  a batch of training instances, a float torch tensor of shape (n by p). n is the number instances in a batch. p is the number of features.
        Output:
            a: the nonlinear activation tensor, a float torch tensor of shape (n by p)
        Note: please do NOT use th.nn.Tanh, th.tanh, th.nn.functional.tanh or sigmoid function, implement your own version using basic tensor operations, such as exp(), div(), etc.
